    "Workbooks for discussion section will always be broken down into three parts. This will allow your TA/IAs to see how far you've gotten, reviewing each part before you leave section. Sometimes you may not get through everything. That's ok! Workbooks with all code filled in will be posted the following week. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook, you'll get practice with the following:\n",
    "- math vs. programing variables\n",
    "- dictionaries\n",
    "- indexing\n",
    "- functions"

While these will not be autograded, it's good to get practice now so that you don't lose unecessary points due to lack of attention to detail in your assignments later.\n",

    "There will be assert cells throughout. If you successfully accommplish the stated programming task and run the cell, the assert cell should run without a problem. However, if you make an error in your code, the assert cell may error."
